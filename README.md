# admin-dashboard
Thanks to Odin Project curriculum, my path crossed this brilliant project idea. 


What i learned?
-got to practice the grid and flex together
-how to better style some elements
-more practice of html, css and how to write faster code with emmet.
-that i should commit more often (something that i didn't do on this project)
-write summary on the readme right when you finish the project, not a week after.
